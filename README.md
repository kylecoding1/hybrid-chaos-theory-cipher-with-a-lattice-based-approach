# hybrid-chaos-theory-cipher-with-a-lattice-based-approach

## Introduction

Quantum computing threatens traditional cryptography. This paper presents a new, potentially quantum-resistant cipher that combines chaos theory and lattice-based methods for efficient and unique digital security.

The above graph shows the key generation comparison between different cryptographic systems, including Kyber and our hybrid chaos-lattice method (highlighted in red).

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation cycles.

The graph above shows the encapsulation comparison. Here again, our hybrid chaos-lattice method is highlighted in red.

## Decapsulation
Decapsulation cycles.

The graph above shows the decapsulation comparison, with our hybrid chaos-lattice method marked in red.

Summary
By looking at these graphs, you can analyze the performance of our method compared to other cryptographic systems. You can identify where our system is more efficient and make observations about the key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation cycles.
