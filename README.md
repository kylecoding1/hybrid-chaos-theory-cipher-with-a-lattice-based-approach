# hybrid-chaos-theory-cipher-with-a-lattice-based-approach

## Introduction

With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods are at risk of becoming obsolete. Quantum-resistant algorithms are urgently needed to ensure the continued security of digital communication. This paper introduces a novel cryptographic scheme that integrates chaos theory and a lattice-based approach to create a unique, efficient, and potentially quantum-resistant cipher.
