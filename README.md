Key Generation Cycles: 9,655,600

Encryption (Encapsulation) Cycles: 2,276,700

Decryption (Decapsulation) Cycles: 1,901,700


## Stress Testing

- **Decryption Success: True**: The successful decryption indicates that my encryption and decryption algorithms are working cohesively. Encrypted data can be successfully decrypted back to its original form, showing functional correctness.
- **Differential Percentage: 99.3042%**: A high differential percentage between encrypted messages demonstrates that small changes in the input lead to significant changes in the output. This is a desirable feature, as it makes cryptanalysis more difficult.
- **Entropy of Encrypted Messages: 7.7884 and 7.7734 bits**: High entropy values for the encrypted messages indicate that the characters are uniformly distributed. This makes it harder for attackers to find patterns, enhancing security.
- **Estimated Key Entropy: 256.0 bits**: This shows that the key space is vast, making brute-force attacks infeasible. A 256-bit key size is considered secure against current cryptographic attacks.
- **Key Generation Cycles: 9,655,600 cycles**: This measures the computational cost of key generation. While not extremely fast, it's within a range that can be considered practical for many applications.
- **Encryption and Decryption Cycles**: These values (2,276,700 and 1,901,700 cycles, respectively) represent the computational cost for encrypting and decrypting messages. They are acceptable for many use-cases and highlight the efficiency of my encryption scheme.
- **Private Key Entropy: 32,768 bits (approximately)**: This high entropy of the private key further adds to the security of the cryptographic system, making it resilient against attacks that try to predict or guess the key.
- **Entropy of Shared Secret Key: 256.0 bits**: The shared secret key's entropy shows that it's robust and secure, conforming to modern security standards.



 ## Conclusion
The Chaos-Lattice method uniquely combines the mathematical complexity of lattice-based cryptography with the intriguing properties of chaos maps. The lattice part ensures quantum resilience, while the chaos map adds an additional layer of complexity and uniqueness to the encryption process. By carefully integrating these components, the Chaos-Lattice method aims to provide a fast and secure cryptographic system.
