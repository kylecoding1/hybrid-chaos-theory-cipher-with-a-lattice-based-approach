## Stress Testing and Performance Analysis
A comprehensive set of stress tests was conducted to validate the performance and security features of the Chaos-Lattice model:

- **Decryption Success**: Demonstrated functional correctness through successful encryption and decryption of data.
- **Differential Percentage**: Achieved a 99.3042% differential, making cryptanalysis challenging.
- **Entropy of Encrypted Messages**: The high entropy indicates uniform distribution, obstructing pattern detection.
- **Key Entropy**: With 256-bit key size, brute-force attacks become infeasible.
- **Cycle Metrics**: Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption cycles were measured to be practical for various applications.
- **Private Key and Shared Secret Key Entropy**: The robust entropy values ensure resilience against key prediction or guessing.
