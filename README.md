# Hybrid Chaos-Lattice Cipher: A Lattice-Based Approach with Chaos Theory

## Introduction
In the era of quantum computing, the landscape of cryptography is rapidly evolving. The Chaos-Lattice method, developed in our lab, is at the forefront of this evolution. This method ingeniously integrates chaos theory with lattice-based cryptography to forge a cryptographic solution that is not only innovative and efficient but also resistant to the threats posed by quantum computing. 

## Methodology
The Chaos-Lattice method embraces the fascinating dynamics of chaos maps and the quantum resilience of lattice structures to construct a robust and novel cryptographic system.

## Stress Testing and Performance Analysis
A comprehensive set of stress tests was conducted to validate the performance and security features of the Chaos-Lattice model:

- **Decryption Success: True**: The successful decryption indicates that my encryption and decryption algorithms are working cohesively. Encrypted data can be successfully decrypted back to its original form, showing functional correctness.
- **Differential Percentage: 99.3042%**: A high differential percentage between encrypted messages demonstrates that small changes in the input lead to significant changes in the output. This is a desirable feature, as it makes cryptanalysis more difficult.
- **Entropy of Encrypted Messages: 7.7884 and 7.7734 bits**: High entropy values for the encrypted messages indicate that the characters are uniformly distributed. This makes it harder for attackers to find patterns, enhancing security.
- **Estimated Key Entropy: 256.0 bits**: This shows that the key space is vast, making brute-force attacks infeasible. A 256-bit key size is considered secure against current cryptographic attacks.
- **Key Generation Cycles: 9,655,600 cycles**: This measures the computational cost of key generation. While not extremely fast, it's within a range that can be considered practical for many applications.
- **Encryption and Decryption Cycles**: These values (2,276,700 and 1,901,700 cycles, respectively) represent the computational cost for encrypting and decrypting messages. They are acceptable for many use-cases and highlight the efficiency of my encryption scheme.
- **Private Key Entropy: 32,768 bits (approximately)**: This high entropy of the private key further adds to the security of the cryptographic system, making it resilient against attacks that try to predict or guess the key.
- **Entropy of Shared Secret Key: 256.0 bits**: The shared secret key's entropy shows that it's robust and secure, conforming to modern security standards.
